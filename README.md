# RandFourBoost

## Overview
RandFourBoost is a hybrid ensemble learning approach developed as part of an academic thesis. It integrates Random Forest, Fourier-based feature analysis, and Boosting techniques to enhance classification accuracy, robustness, and stability in data mining and pattern recognition tasks.

## Objectives
- Improve classification performance using ensemble learning
- Enhance feature representation through Fourier-based analysis
- Increase model robustness and stability using boosting techniques
- Evaluate effectiveness on research datasets

## Methodology
RandFourBoost combines:
- **Random Forest** for ensemble-based decision making
- **Fourier Transform–based feature analysis** to capture frequency-domain characteristics
- **Boosting techniques** to iteratively improve weak learners

The hybrid approach aims to reduce variance, improve generalization, and increase overall accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy / Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for evaluation and visualization)
